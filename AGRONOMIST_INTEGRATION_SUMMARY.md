- **Features**:
  - Tab-based interface with three main sections:
    - **Crop Planning**: Advanced crop management with yield forecasting
    - **Soil Health**: Soil testing and fertilization management  
    - **Irrigation**: Real-time monitoring and intelligent scheduling
  - Clean, professional UI with proper navigation
  - Integrates all existing agronomist components

### 3. Enhanced Main Dashboard
